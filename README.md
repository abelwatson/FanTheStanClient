Fan the Stan Client


Fan the Stan is an app that lets you review on your favorite super heros or villains and to also add them to your personal favorites.



The client was built around Typescript, with using npm install for the following items:

material-ui, types, bootstrap, reactstrap, react-dom, react-dotenv, react-scripts, react-router-dom, styled-components

You will need to create your own database, whether local or hosted, and create your own dotenv with your application's information, eg. DB_DBNAME, DB_USER, etc.

Future Goals:
Admin can view other members and delete them if necessary.
